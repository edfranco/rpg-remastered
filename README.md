## Do You like Roleplaying Games?
Are you a fan of table top games like Dungeons and Dragons?

Did you you enjoy games like the Elder Scrolls Games, Fallout, and The Witcher?

Awesome! This is not the game for you. This is not a very good RPG but it's a cool concept I wanted to play with. This game has the basic RPG elements such as, branching storylines, quests, and inventory management
